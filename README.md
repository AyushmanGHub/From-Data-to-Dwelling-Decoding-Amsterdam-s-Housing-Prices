# From Data to Dwelling: Decoding Amsterdam's Housing Prices 
<hr style="border: 0; height: 3px; background-color: black;">

## Abstract
This project aims to analyze and predict **housing prices in Amsterdam** using data from August 2021. The primary goal is to **identify trends affecting housing prices**. By analyzing predictors such as property area, number of rooms, and geographic location, the project will explore relationships through exploratory data analysis (EDA). A predictive model, using Simple regression, will be developed to estimate prices and provide insights into the market.
